                The Philippines branch serves Japanese businesses in the Philippines that manufacture and export products to Japan, Europe, America, and Asia. The branch was established as an office in Manila in 1998 in order to provide clients with document and packaging services. And as demand grew, the branch shifted from importing to producing locally. Through services, such as just-in-time delivery, the branch is always working to meet the clients' needs.
